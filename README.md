# CodeJam-2017-Lehman-Loop

Hello there!

My name is Jocelyn B. Mercado and I am a sophomore computer science major at Lehman College. I'm interested in learning as much as I can, music, dancing, and books. I often try to teach myself how to code in different languages so as to immerse myself in my studies.
