# CodeJam-2017-Lehman-Loop\

## Jocelyn Mercado

#### This is a project that took third place at Lehman College's CodeJam. I worked with a team for six hours making a calendar website that would replace the Lehman College email system. The site, called the Lehman Loop, would display events happening on a selected date. It would also have the capacity to implement a tagging system so as to allow users to select certain tags for events based on their interests, but this system was not implemented in the code due to time constraints. However, the elements that we do have up and running are the buttons that would implement the tagging system. We used two documents whose contents were read by the program to test out the code.
